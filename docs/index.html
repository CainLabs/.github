            <h2>Is This Your Team's Audit Cycle?</h2>
            <p>Preparing for a compliance audit often feels like a high-stakes, resource-draining marathon. Your best engineers are pulled off revenue-generating projects to spend days digging through dense vendor documentation and manually checking configurations across every in-scope system, knowing that a single missed setting could mean a failed audit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wasted Engineering Hours:</strong> Your team spends countless hours on tedious manual checks instead of critical project work.</li>
                <li><strong>Constant Audit Anxiety:</strong> You worry that inconsistent, error-prone manual checks will miss a critical finding, putting the business at risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibitive Costs:</strong> You can't afford expensive, enterprise-grade security suites or a team of consultants, leaving your small team to handle the immense pressure alone.</li>
            </ul>
