            <h2><i data-feather="flag"></i> Our Story</h2>
            <p>CainCyberLabs was founded on a simple principle: the discipline and rigor of military-grade cybersecurity shouldn't be reserved for large enterprises and government agencies. Every business, regardless of size, deserves access to expert-level tools that provide real, verifiable security.</p>
            <p>Our founder is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who transitioned into a career as a Cyber Systems Security Engineer. For over ten years, he worked on the front lines of national security, hardening critical DoD systems, achieving Authority to Operate (ATO) for new platforms, and mastering the complex compliance frameworks of STIGs and NIST 800-53.</p>
            <p>This experience revealed a major gap in the market: small to mid-sized businesses were left to navigate the complex world of compliance with either inadequate tools or prohibitively expensive consultants. CainCyberLabs was created to bridge that gap by translating elite, real-world expertise into affordable, automated, and easy-to-use solutions.</p>
